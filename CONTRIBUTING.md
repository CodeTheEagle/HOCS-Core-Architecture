# Contributing to HOCS

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the HOCS (Hybrid Optical Computing System) project! We are a student-led initiative, and any help—whether it's code, hardware advice, or documentation—is highly appreciated.

## 🚧 Current State & Needs
Our primary workstation is currently down. We are prioritizing:
1.  **Hardware Verification:** If you have a Xilinx Kria KV260, please test our bitstreams.
2.  **Code Review:** Review the `hocs_exascale_driver.py` for optimization.
3.  **Sponsorship:** We are looking for hardware sponsors (Workstation/FPGA).

## 🔨 How to Contribute
1.  **Fork** the repository.
2.  Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`
3.  Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`
4.  Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`
5.  Open a **Pull Request**.

## 📜 Coding Standards
* **Python:** Follow PEP 8 style guide.
* **Verilog:** Use standard indentation and comment your modules.
* **Commits:** Please write clear, descriptive commit messages.

Thank you for helping us light up the future of computing! 🇹🇷
